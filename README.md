# Healthcare-Facial-Recognition

For this IT Capstone Project, there will be research pertaining to the ability to use facial recognition as a form of healthcare identification during the emergency department admission process. This could benefit healthcare facilities in a plethora of ways including, but not limited to, an efficient patient identification process that maintains a high standard of patient confidentiality.

What the implementation of this technology would look like is a patient enters the emergency department and instead of being asked for their name, driver’s license, and medical card as a form of identification, their face is automatically recognized by the software, as they enter the facility providing easy look. For example, a patient calls their physician and their chief complaint is a fever, body ache, and fatigue. This information will be stored in the patient’s medical records on a database. Upon entrance of the facility the patient’s face is recognized and at the desk,  and by the click of a button it may say “Jacob Park, Possible flu” along with other information like medical record number or date of birth, making it easier to direct patients throughout the healthcare facility, essentially decreasing the emergency department wait and transferring times. This could also improve patient experience and decrease risk of identification fraud.
