# IT-Captstone-Project

For this IT Capstone Project, there will be research pertaining to the ability to use facial recognition as a form of healthcare identification during the emergency department admission process. This could benefit healthcare facilities in many ways including, but not limited to, an efficient patient identification process that maintains a high standard of patient confidentiality.  A patient enters the emergency department and instead of being asked their name and date birth as a form of identification, their facial recognition is automatically scanned as they enter the facility. For example, a patient calls the doctor and their chief complaint is a fever, body aches, and fatigue. This information will then be stored on the patient’s medical records. Once they enter the hospital their face will be recognized at the desk and it may suggest “Jacob Parks, Possible Flu” making it easier to direct patients throughout the healthcare facility, essentially decreasing emergency department wait and transferring times
